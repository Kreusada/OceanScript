Encoding
========

Encoding into oceanscript looks challenging at first,
but it sure doesn't take too long to get into the swing of it.

Start by visualizing 4 boxes. These boxes can be used to write
oceanscript, and in my opinion it is the best way to get started.
They look like this:

.. csv-table::
   :file: /tables.csv
   :widths: 2 2 2 2 2
