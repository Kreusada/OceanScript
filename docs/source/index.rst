OceanScript Documentation
=========================

Welcome! OceanScript is an Esoteric language used to encode and decode text into
a formulation of characters - where the final result looks like waves in the ocean.

This site will help you to learn the basics of how to encode and decode oceanscript.
There is also information on the Python implementation and how to use it.
